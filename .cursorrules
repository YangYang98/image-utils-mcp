# Cursor Rules for image-utils-mcp

This project implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to provide various tools including calculator, weather, image processing, web search, time and text-to-image conversion.

## Access Instructions

To access this service from Cursor:

1. Add this server to your MCP configuration
2. The service exposes tools via standard MCP protocol
3. Tools available:
   - calculator: Performs basic mathematical operations
   - weather: Gets weather information for a location
   - imageprocessing: Processes images with various operations
   - websearch: Searches the web for information
   - time: Gets current time in various formats
   - text2image: Converts text to image

## Tool Call Specifications

When calling MCP tools, you must send POST requests to `/tools/{tool_name}` endpoint, where {tool_name} is the specific tool name. The `/tools` root endpoint only supports GET requests to get the tool list and does not support POST method.

Each MCP tool must provide clear parameter descriptions, including parameter name, type, whether required, default value, and purpose description to ensure that large models can correctly understand and call them.

## Character Encoding Guidelines

To ensure proper handling of Chinese and other non-ASCII characters:

1. Clients should use UTF-8 encoding when sending requests
2. HTTP request headers should include `Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8`
3. The server automatically handles multiple encoding formats, but if Chinese characters appear as question marks, please check the client's encoding settings
